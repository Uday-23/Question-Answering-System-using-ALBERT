She went on to star in Anaconda (1997) and Out of Sight (1998), and has subsequently established herself as one of the highest-paid Latin actresses worldwide as of 2017.[3] Lopez is considered a pop culture icon, and is often described as a triple threat entertainer.[4][5][6]\n","\n","Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album On the 6 (1999), which helped propel the Latin pop movement in American music.
